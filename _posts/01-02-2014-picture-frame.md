One inch picture frame, from Anne Lamott (bird by bird)

<style>
.one {
	border: 1px solid black;
	width: 10em;
	height: 10em;
	padding: 0.25em;
	font: @font;
}
.one:focus {
	outline: none;
	border: 1px solid green;
}
</style>

<textarea class="one">
</textarea>

write what you can see through a one-inch picture frame + literal interpretation of how tiny it really is (one paragraph and we're done)

(maybe here add an interaction for encouragement - a tiny progress bar?)

make it so that finishing a box generates a finished piece with timestamp (a la tekstflyt)

TODO: how do we know when you're done? maybe just submits and clears/equivalent of jquery change?
